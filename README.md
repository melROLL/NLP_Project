# NLP Project

Welcome to my NLP Project repository! This project focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis. It includes data, a Jupyter notebook, and Python preprocessing scripts to help you get started with NLP tasks.
The Theme of this Project is True News and Fake news

## Contents

- [Data](#data)
- [Jupyter Notebook](#jupyter-notebook)
- [Preprocessing Script](#preprocessing-script)

## Data

In the `data` directory, you will find the following CSV files:

- `True.csv`: This CSV file contains data about true news articles.
- `Fake.csv`: This CSV file contains data about fake news articles.

These datasets are essential for training and testing NLP models.

## Jupyter Notebook

Explore and analyze the data with the Jupyter notebook provided in this repository. The notebook can be a helpful starting point for understanding the data and experimenting with NLP techniques.

## Preprocessing Script

The Python preprocessing script, named `preprocessing.py`, is available for data cleaning and text preprocessing tasks. You can use this script to perform essential NLP tasks, such as removing punctuation, stopwords, and stemming words. It's a valuable tool for preparing the data for analysis and model training.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nlp-project.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nlp-project
```

3. Use the provided Jupyter notebook and preprocessing script to explore the data and perform NLP tasks.
